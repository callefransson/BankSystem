# BankSystem 

BankSystem is a program where you log in to a bank. Depending on your role (administrator or user) you will start with a menu of options once logged in successfully. When logged in as a user, your menu consists of viewing your bankaccounts, applying for a loan, transferring money between your own accounts or to other users and viewing all of your transactions. When logged in as an administrator, your menu will contain adding a new user, deleting an existing user, view a list of all existing users and updating the daily exhange rate.

## Background
The program is developed according to a backlog with a requirements specification. It is a grading group project where we have figured out and learned how to work as a team with contributions on GitHub.
